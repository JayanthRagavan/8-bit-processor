8-bit Processor
A simple 8-bit Processor designed to simulate the basic functions of a microprocessor, including data manipulation, arithmetic operations, and control flow. This project is aimed at providing a deep understanding of the architecture and functioning of basic computer systems.

Features
8-bit ALU: Perform arithmetic and logic operations (addition, subtraction, AND, OR, etc.).
Registers: Store intermediate results and data.
Program Counter (PC): Manage the execution flow of the program by keeping track of the address of the next instruction.
Instruction Set: A simple set of instructions to demonstrate processor operations.
Basic Memory Management: Load and store operations for managing data in memory.
Clock Cycle Simulation: Emulate clock cycles to represent the execution of instructions.
Goals
Educational Purpose: Designed to help students and enthusiasts learn about processor architecture and how processors handle data and instructions.
Simple Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): Implementing a basic set of instructions to demonstrate processor functionality.
Hands-on Experience: Provide an opportunity to work directly with processor operations, registers, memory, and control flow.
Extendable Architecture: The processor is designed in a way that can be expanded to include more complex operations and features.
Future Directions
Expand Instruction Set: Add more complex instructions such as division, multiplication, and branching operations.
Integrate I/O Operations: Implement input and output functionalities, allowing interaction with external systems.
Simulate a Basic Operating System: Develop a minimal OS that interacts with the 8-bit processor.
Add Interrupt Handling: Implement interrupt handling to simulate real-world processor functionality.
Improve UI/Visualization: Create a graphical interface to visualize the state of the processor, registers, and memory.
Increase Bit Width: Extend the processor to handle more than 8 bits, enabling the simulation of more advanced architectures.
Optimization: Enhance the performance of the processor simulation by introducing optimizations and parallel processing concepts.
